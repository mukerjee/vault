# Feature Deprecation FAQ

This page provides frequently asked questions concerning decisions made about Vault feature deprecations. If you are looking for information about Vault licensing, refer to the [Licensing FAQ](/docs/enterprise/license/faq) page.

- [Q: What is the impact to anyone using the legacy MFA feature?](#q-what-is-the-impact-to-anyone-using-the-legacy-mfa-feature)
- [Q: I'm currently using the Etcd storage backend feature. How does the deprecation impact me?](#q-i-m-currently-using-the-etcd-storage-backend-feature-how-does-the-deprecation-impact-me)
- [Q: What should I be doing if I am using Mount Filters, AppID, or any of the standalone DB engines?](#q-what-is-the-impact-to-anyone-using-the-legacy-mfa-feature)

### Q: What is the impact to anyone using the legacy MFA feature?

If you are an Enterprise Vault user, there is no impact. There are no changes to the Enterprise MFA offering.

If you are an OSS user and are using the legacy MFA, this will impact you since we plan to deprecate the legacy MFA feature. However, while we will continue to provide support for MFA in Vault OSS in the upcoming Vault 1.10 release, our target is to remove the legacy MFA feature from the product in the following Vault 1.11 release. Therefore, you should plan to migrate to the new MFA feature when Vault OSS supports it.

### Q: I'm currently using the Etcd storage backend feature. How does the deprecation impact me?

If you are using Etcd v2 API, you must plan to upgrade to Etcd v3 API when they upgrade to Vault 1.10. The Etcd v2 API will not be supported in the Vault 1.10 release.

If you are an Enterprise user, we recommend that you consider migrating to HashiCorp supported storage backends: Integrated Storage, or Consul (if your use case requires you to use this). Your HashiCorp sales or support representative can assist you with this decision.

### Q: What should I be doing if I am using Mount Filters, AppID, or any of the standalone DB engines?

These features were deprecated in prior releases of Vault. We are targeting the removal of these features from the product in the Vault 1.11 release. Refer to the table below for a list of alternative features.

| Decprecated Feature    | Alternative Feature |
| -----------------------| --------------------|
| Mount Filters          | [Path Filters](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/system/replication/replication-performance#create-paths-filter)|
| AppID                  | [AppRole auth method](/docs/auth/approle)|
| Standalone DB engines  | [Combined DB engines](/docs/secrets/databases)|
