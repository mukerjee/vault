# Vault 1.9.0 Release notes

**Software Release Date**: November 19, 2021

**Summary**: This document captures major updates as part of Vault release 1.9.0, including new features, breaking changes, enhancements, deprecation, and EOL plans. Readers should refer to the [changelog]() for any other details.

## New features

This section describes the new features introduced as part of Vault 1.9.0.

### Client count improvements

Several improvements to client count were made to help customers better track and identify client attribution.

#### Improved computation of client counts and usability within the usage metrics UI

The improvements made include the following:
* New logic enables de-duplication of non-entity tokens, thereby reducing their contribution towards the client count.
* New logic allows entities to be created for local auth mounts, thereby eliminating  non-entity-tokens being  issued by the local auth mounts and reducing the overall client count.
* Displays client counts per namespace (top ten) in the usage metrics UI, with the ability to export data for all namespaces.
* Displays clients earlier than a month in the usage metrics UI (within ten minutes since initiation of computation)

### Advanced Data Protection Module (ADP) enhancements

The following section provides details about the ADP module features added in this release.

#### Advanced I/O handling for Tranform FPE (ADP-Transform)

This feature provides users of the ADP Transform FPE capability with increased flexibility in generating input and output. This feature includes the ability to specify which capture groups within the input regex need to be encoded or decoded and the format of the encoded value.

#### MS SQL TDE (ADP)

## Other enhancements

### Agent Persistent Cache improvements

TBD

### Customized username generation for database dynamic credentials

This feature enables customization of username for database dynamic credentials. This should help customers better manage and correlate usernames for various actions such as troubleshooting etc. Vault 1.9 supports Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB.

### Customizable HTTP headers for Vault

This features allows security operators to configure custom headers to HTTP root path (/) and API endpoints (/v1/*), in addition to the previously supported UI paths through the server HCL configuration file. If desired, this will enable customers to add custom security headers at these paths, thereby maintaining an improved security posture.

### Executing Vault on s390x CPU architecture

This feature adds support for Vault to run on the x390x architecture via the equivalent binary.


### Namespace API Lock

This feature provides namespace administrators to flexibly control operations such as locking APIs from child namespaces to which they have access. This enables them to restrict access to their domain in a multi-tenant environment and perform break-glass procedures in times of emergency to protect a cluster from within their child namespace.

## UI enhancements

### Expanding the UI for more DB secrets engines

We have been adding support for DB secrets engines in the UI over the past few releases. In the Vault 1.9 release, we have added support for Oracle and ElasticSearch DB secrets engines in the UI.

### PKI certificate metadata

This enhancement adds support for additional PKI certificate metadata in the UI, such as Date issued, Date of expiry, serial number, subject/name.

### Customized metadata for KV

This enhancement provides the ability to set custom metadata for Vault KVv2 secrets via a map structure. This custom metadata will also be visible in the UI.

## GA support for previously supported Tech Preview Features

### Key Management Secrets (KMS) Engine - GCP

The KMS Engine for GCP was introduced as a Tech Preview feature in Vault 1.8. As of 1.9 it is supported as GA.

## Tech Preview Features

### KV: Patch Operations

This feature provides a more streamlined method for managing KV secrets, enabling customers to better maintain least privilege security in automated environments. It allows for writing new KV secrets and new versions for existing KV secrets without having to provide the ability to read from the engine. This feature also provides the ability to read a key from a KV endpoint but not the value.

### Vault as an OIDC Provider

## Breaking changes

The following section details breaking changes introduced with Vault 1.9.

### Removal of HTTP Request Counters

In Vault 1.9, the [internal HTTP Request count API](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/system/internal-counters#http-requests) backwards removed from the product. Calls to the endpoint will result in a **404 error** with a message stating that functionality on this path has been removed.
Please refer to the [upgrade guide](/docs/upgrading/upgrade-to-1.9.0) for more information.

As called out in the documentation, Vault does not make backwards compatible guarantees on internal APIs (those prefaced with `sys/internal`). They are subject to change and may disappear without notice.

## Other enhancements
